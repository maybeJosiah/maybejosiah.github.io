<h1>About programming with me</h1>
<p>I have been programming for 7+ years. That may not be professional experience but I have been programming that long. I started programming on Lego NXT devices. Later I started more complex things such as programming languages as below. Now nearly if it can be programmed, I program it. I do Android, Apple, Windows, Linux, web, and cross platform development. I plan to also do stuff for game systems soon. I have worked with sensors, cameras, microphones, and other things.</p>
<h2>How I learned things</h2>
<p>I learned Ruby online with its official documentation including <a href="https://try.ruby-lang.org">Try Ruby</a>. I learned Kotlin online through its online book thing, <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html">Kotlin</a>. I learned Javascript by a book on it and much experience. I learned Java and XML programming for a robotics team that used Android phones. I learned Swift from online documentation. I learned PHP, HTML and CSS from <a href="https://w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>. I learned Python at Brightpoint Community College and before that from a local documentation of it. C++ I learned with Brightpoint and Android programming. SQL I learned in a class at Brightpoint. Rust, Go, and GLSL I am still learning and learned from their respective official things. WebVTT I learned at Brightpoint. Bash I learned while trying to back up an Ubuntu machine.</p>
<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
<p>I have made an algebra math system for Javascript. I have made a sense all, like basically if your phone can know it, it shows it, app for Android. I have made Android apps to control robots. I am making 3 or more dimensional up to any number of dimensions drawing math libraries in many programming languages, <a href="https://gugquettex.com/en/project/stinomxe/index.php">StinomXE</a>. I made 2d maze game levels in HTML and Javascript. I have made scripts to backup, restore, and transfer timestamps from Linux on Ext4 file systems. Those scripts can transfer to Windows and possibly Mac too.</p>

<p>All as per one might be maybe or might not be maybe, maybe or maybe not, maybe.</p>
