        <h1>General about me:</h1>
        <p>I like frozen stuff. I actually eat lime and lemon juice. I like gradients in case you can't tell. I was a construction worker. I am mechanically inclined. I used to like Legos. I built pinball things like machines with Legos. I do graphics design. I use Ubuntu Pro as like my main computer OS but Windows for school. That <== is a video of where I work on things.</p>
